My dataset is from kaggle competition, https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata/kernels
and I want to do some movie analysis, just like Steam Game analysis I've done before.
I used Python to extract data which contains json part in excel, and use some machine learning models to 
predict whether the movie is good or not, based on different aspects, then use cross validation to estimate the accuracy.

Besides, after taken dataset apart to some detailed datasets, I upload them to Mysql to simply analyse the data, and extract some
importment information.
