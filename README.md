# movie_analysis

I choose this topic beacuase I'm really interested in games, movies, songs and some other entertainment subjects.

So I wanted to use Python to build some machine learning models, like random forest, decision tree, k-n-n, and predicted if movies are good.
Before that, It was very important to convert json file to a normal one, because after that it would be much easilier to extract information.

In addition, you should think about how to found a way to make decision about which movie is a good movie.

Besides, I used MySQL to make some simply analysis, like how the popularity and budget influence the vote or what is the watching trend 
for decades years, etc.
