# movie_analysis

I choose this topic beacuase I'm really interested in game, movies, songs and some other entertainment subjects.

So I wanted to use Python to build some machine learning models, like random forest, decision tree, k-n-n, and predict if movies is good,

and I used MySQL to make some simply analysis, like how the popularity and budget influence the vote or what is the watching trend 
for decades years, etc.
